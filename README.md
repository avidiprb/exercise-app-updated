# exercise-app-updated
This is an updated version of the quiz app from Lab 10 where for the duration exercise, in this case bicycling, there is a new component where calories are recorded specifically for the bicycling exercise. Also the other new component is if it is less that 5 minutes there is a message that says "You can do this!" else it will say "Great job! Stop anytime if you do not have the energy!" to prevent someone from overestimating themselves due to being new to exercising. That's for the duration exercise. For the running exercise there are two new components as well. The first one is a new component where calories are recorded specifically for the running exercise. The other new component is if it is less that 5 minutes there is a message that says "You can do this!" else it will say "Great job! Stop anytime if you do not have the energy!" For the repetition exercise there is one new component where during push ups, if it is less than 20 reps it will say "You can do this!" else it will say "Great job! Stop anytime if you do not have the energy!"
